# A chrome web extension for confirmify

This is an accompanying extension to the Ripple [POC](https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/xrp-confirmify-poc/blob/main/README.md) - please start exploring there.

## Setup
It's JavaScript, how hard can it be :-)

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

With the app running visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), activate the developer mode and click on `Load Unpacked`.

Next, select the `dist` ordner that has been created by npm and you are good to go.
